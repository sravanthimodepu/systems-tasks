** Cost Estimation for the month of November
*** Cost Estimation for Instances    
   - Cost estimation for EC2 instance
     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     1 instance  => 24hrs * 30days = 720hrs  
     93 insances => 720hrs * 93 = 66,960 hrs
     1 instance => $0.0062 => 66,960 * $0.0062 = $415.152
     #+END_EXAMPLE
   - Cost estimation for EBS
     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     1 instance  => 24hrs * 30days = 720hrs
     2 instance  => 720hrs  * 2 = 1440hrs
     1 instance  => $0.0124 * 1440 = $17.856 
     #+END_EXAMPLE
   - Cost estimation for small instance
     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     1 instance  => 24hrs * 30days = 720 hrs
     1 instance  => $0.0248 * 720  = $17.856
     #+END_EXAMPLE
   - Total Cost for all the Instances in Mumbai region = *$450.864* 
*** Cost estimation for EBS(volumes & snapshots)
   - Cost estiamtion for Volumes (gp2 - 45)
     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     1 Month  => $0.114/GB
     1580GB   => 1580* $0.114 = $180.12 
     #+END_EXAMPLE
   - Cost estimation for volumes (standard - 53)
     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     1 Month  => $0.08/GB
     1622GB   => 1622* 0.08 = $129.76
     #+END_EXAMPLE
   - Cost estimation for I/O requests (considering last month usage)
     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     $0.08 / 1 Million I/O => 198,476,312* $0.08 => $15.88
     #+END_EXAMPLE
   - Cost estimation for snapshots (considering last month data GB)
     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     $0.05 / GB  => 1599.534GB * $0.05 = $79.98  
     #+END_EXAMPLE
   - Total cost for the EBS in Mumbai region = *$405.82* 
*** Cost for the US East (N.Virginia) region
    - As there is one Elastic IP (54.85.93.7), cost for the Elastic IP
      address not attached to a running instance per hour $0.005
      #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      288hrs * $0.005 = $1.44
      #+END_EXAMPLE
*** Cost for the US West (N.California)
    - Cost for the snapshot storage $0.055/GB
      #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      303.808GB * $0.055 = $16.71 
      #+END_EXAMPLE
*** Data Transfer & Simple Storage Service(S3)
    - Considering the October month cost for Data transfer *$6.76* and for S3, the cost is *$0.44*

*** Estimated the bill without stopped instances

    - Calculating for As per the July month, there was 83 instances, 96 volumes and
      111 snapshots.
    - As we dont have the count for the type of instances, so
      calculating the least cost for all the 83 instances is $0.0062.
    - Cost estimation for nano instances
      #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      1 instance   => 24hrs * 30days = 720hrs
      83 instances => 720 * 83 = 59,760 hrs
      1 instance   => $0.0062 => 59760 * $0.0062 = 370.512
      #+END_EXAMPLE
    - Cost estimation for EBS
      #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      1 month =>  $0.114/GB
      3202 GB =>  $0.114* 3202 => $365.02 
      #+END_EXAMPLE
   - Cost estimated for I/O requests and magnetic provisioned storage
     is *$171.27*
   - For other S3, Data storage, US East(N.Virginia) and US West
      N(california), the approximated bill is *$25.35*
   - Total bill calculated without stopped instances for mumbai
      region is *932.16* 
* Billing Report as per SD2
   - Calculated the bill for the month of July, as it was the last
     month with SD2 with the proper instances.
   - Locus started the migration process in the month of August  
** US East(N.Virginia) region
   - There are 83 Instances, 96 Volumes, 111 Snapshots.
   - Estimated cost for instances  
     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     1 instance  => 24hrs * 30days = 720hrs  
     83 insances => 720hrs * 83 = 59,760 hrs
     1 instance => $0.006 => 66,960 * $0.006 = $358.56
     #+END_EXAMPLE
   - Estimated cost for Volumes  
     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     
     #+END_EXAMPLE
** US West (N. California) region
   - There are
     Instances: 0
     Volumes: 0
     Snapshots: 08
** Total bill for the month of July 2018
   - After calculating the US East(N.Virginia) and US
     West(N.California), the total bill we recieved is $624.6
     
| Instances | Type      |   | EBS   | storage type         |
|-----------+-----------+---+-------+----------------------|
| $0.0116   | t2.micro  |   | $0.05 | snapshot             |
|-----------+-----------+---+-------+----------------------|
| $0.0232   | t2.small  |   | $0.05 | I/O requests         |
|-----------+-----------+---+-------+----------------------|
| $0.0464   | t2.medium |   | $0.05 | magnetic             |
|-----------+-----------+---+-------+----------------------|
| $0.133    | m3.large  |   | $0.10 | General purpose(gp2) |
|-----------+-----------+---+-------+----------------------|

* Conclusion
    - We have estimated the instances cost but not for the volumes and
      snapshots, when we had a meeting with locus on [[https://gitlab.com/vlead-systems/reduce-aws-bill/blob/master/src/mom/20-07-2018.org][20-07-2018]],
    - During July Month there are only 86 instances in Virginia region
      and now in November there are 96 instances, we need to stop some
      of the instances in Mumbai region.
    - As per my observation, comparing both the Virgina & Mumbai
      region:
      * Instances & EBS cost is more in Mumbai region compared with
        Virginia region.
